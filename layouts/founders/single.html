          <p>School for poetic computation was founded by Amit, Jen, Taeyoon and Zach in 2013. We are a group of artists, hackers and educators who are super committed to open source and open hardware, to radical openness and generosity. Each semester, we work with new teachers and visiting artists to make an ideal school. In spring 2014, Zach, Taeyoon and Casey are leading administration of the school.
