“With <a href="http://www.minsunmini.com/projects/hacking-hangeul-playing-with-language-sound/">Hacking Hangeul</a>, I wanted to use the Korean written language system like a code, and wanted the viewer to assign their own sound to each of the 26 symbols. It is almost like the viewers are making their own spoken language.”
