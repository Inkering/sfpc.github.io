â€œ<a href="http://www.luhwei.com/gcs/">Generative Calligraphy</a>  is an experiment in bringing mathematically generated forms into the physical world. I began by exploring parametric equations and lissajous figures. This resulted in a program that drew an interesting calligraphy-esque form, that looks more like it was produced by a human than a computer."
