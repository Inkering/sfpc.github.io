## Call for Students: Code Societies
- Three-Week Session, Monday January 7th - Saturday January 26th
- SFPC, 155 Bank street, West Village, NYC
- 6:30pm - 9:30pm, Evening Classes
- [**Apply now!**](https://airtable.com/shrbFALyK5MRnXpP1), competitive rolling admissions. 


SFPC’s winter intensive will examine the ideological and corporeal attributes of computation, concentrating on the poetics and politics of culturally embedded software. How do different platforms and processes — including algorithms, data collection, social media, infrastructure, and interface — yield distinct modes of seeing, thinking, feeling, and reinforce existing systems of power? Through a balanced study of critical theory, and hands-on coding workshops, students will create small projects that explore and question these ideas.

The session will begin with a brief introduction to programming with Python and navigating the command line. No coding experience necessary; an enthusiastic willingness to reconsider how code shapes and is shaped by society required!

Central to Code Societies is understanding technology as culture and culture as social technology. Students are encouraged to engage with code and the ways code acts on our bodies and networks equally as subject and as medium. Similarly, Code Societies is both this session’s subject and it’s prompt; an invitation to consider coding and choreographing new ways of being in relation with each other.

Student’s should expect to develop several small scores or sketch pieces that may exist online, on screens, performed, or installed.

*“Technology is not neutral. We're inside of what we make, and it's inside of us. We're living in a world of connections — and it matters which ones get made and unmade.”* - Donna Haraway

- [**Everest Pipkin**](http://www.decontextualize.com/) (*1 Class*) - Everest is a drawing, language and software artist whose work follows landscape as complicated by the advent of digital space. They produce intimate work with large data sets.
- [**Dan Taeyoung**](http://www.dantaeyoung.com/) (*1 Class*) - Dan dreams of, and creates, cybernetic architectures, infrastructures for care, ethical pedagogy, and warm cooperatives. He teaches at the Graduate School of Architecture Planning and Preservation at Columbia University.


- 15 class days in total with a final presentation. More teachers and speakers to be announced!

### How do I apply?
[**Apply now!**](https://airtable.com/shrbFALyK5MRnXpP1)

We accept up to 18 students on a rolling basis. We will respond to your application within 3 weeks of submission. Rolling admissions means there are fewer and fewer slots the longer you wait, so if you’re interested in the program get your application in early! You are likely to 

### How competitive is the admissions?

SFPC admissions is highly competitive. Every session, we receive up to 80 applicants and select 18. We focus on creating diversity among our student body. We work with a group of alumni and teachers to review and select students based on their work samples and essays.  

### How much is tuition?
$3,000 USD for the 3-week program. You’ll also need to cover your own cost of living, including housing and meals (recent alumni report this to be in the range of $800 - $1400). Upon acceptance, payment of full tuition, your space in the class will be reserved. SFPC tuition goes directly to paying for the teachers, organizers, materials and space that make sessions like this possible.

### Do you offer scholarship?

We are completely self-funded, which dramatically limits our ability to offer scholarships. In Code Societies, we are offering three work-study opportunity to a qualified applicant who would be expected to work 5 hrs/week in exchange for a 50% reduction of tuition.  We’re particularly looking out for women, people of color, disabled person, people under-represented in the field of art + technology, and those with financial need.

Please note that if you apply for work study, we will consider your application separately from the general admissions applications, since we have little flexibility regarding scholarships. This is for people who absolutely need assistance to participate in SFPC. Occasionally, students have received support from cultural foundations, schools or current employers and we are happy to provide supporting materials as proof of acceptance.  

### Cancellation and refund policy

- If you are accepted and need to cancel, we can give you 100% refund up to December 15th, 2018.
- 50% refund between December 15th – December 31st, 2018.
- 25% refund between January 1st – January 6th, 2018.
- No refunds can be given after the first day of class.
- Participation is not transferrable to another person.


### What is expected of me?

- Come to all classes and thoughtfully engage with your classmates and teachers.
- We are looking for autodidacts from all backgrounds who are curious, generous and open.
- We welcome students with a broad array of technical experiences–no coding experience is required, but a basic comfort level with technology is preferred.
- B.Y.O.Laptop (Mac / PC / Linux)


### Where is SFPC?

We are located in 155 Bank street, in the courtyard of the Westbeth Artists Community in the West Village, New York City.
