### How can I apply?

Please check our calls for students in the 'Participate' section of this website.

### Is there tuition to attend the school?

Yes, there is a fixed-rate tuition which is based on the cost of running the program and varies by semester.
We are committed to being fully transparent about how we make and spend money. We open-source <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/SFPC/finance-and-administration">our finances on Github</a>, where you can read <a href="">a report on the first semester</a> and download raw financial statements.

Tuition for the first semester of sfpc was $5000 for 10 weeks, and at the end of the semester we offered each student a $700 reimbursement for tuition money that we didn't spend. It makes us happy to give money back to students.

We aspire to provide scholarships to students who cannot afford to attend sfpc, though we are not able to do it yet. However, we have successfully supported few students to receive grants and support from their work, school and institutions. We will be happy to write a letter of recommendation upon your acceptance. 


### How can I help?

If you are interested in helping underwrite scholarships, support our school through sponsorship, please contact admin@sfpc.io for more details. We are also able to receive tax deductible donation through our fiscal sponsor, Eyebeam Art and Technology Center.
