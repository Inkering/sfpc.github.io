### Where do I apply?

Check the Call for Students in the "Participate" section of our website.

### How long is a session?

10 weeks.

### Can non-US citizens apply?

Yes. The 10 week session accommodates international students visiting with a tourist visa.

### What is expected of me?

Our expectation is that students participate fully. This means you are committed to SFPC full-time, attending all classes and doing all the work. What you put into this is not only what you'll get out of it, but what the whole group will too.

### How much is tuition?

$5,000 USD for the 10 week program. We are committed to being fully transparent about how we make and spend money. In the spirit of radical openness and generosity, on which the school was founded, we open-source our finances on Github. There, you can read financial reports and download raw statements.

### Do you offer scholarships?

Not yet. We aspire to provide scholarships but have not been able to so far. However, we have successfully supported several students in receiving grants and financial support from their jobs, schools, and institutions. We are happy to write a letter of recommendation upon your acceptance, and provide any other materials helpful in obtaining independent funding.

### How can I find out about future sessions?

We are planning two 10 week terms, to take place in the Spring and Fall of 2015 in New York. If you subscribe to our mailing list (on the footer of this page) you will be the first to hear when we announce a Call for Students.
