### What is the teaching philosophy?

We celebrate failure and collaboration. Our classes are going to be a mix of lecture, demo and lab hours. We respect our students and support them as artists and educators. We hope our students will have the experience to create projects on their own and teach after the program.

### How much of programming skills do I need to get accepted?

The School encourages students to have some familiarity with programming and technology in general. If you are an absolute beginner, there will be assignments prior to the School that will get you familiar with the medium.

### Why do you teach?

Teaching inspires learning. We love meeting new people and we often make our best work in collaboration with others.


### Who runs the school?

The school was co-founded by Zach Lieberman, Taeyoon Choi, Amit Pitaru and Jen Lowe in 2013. Casey Gollan works on administration for the school. We try to work with new teachers and visitors every session, often times involving our alumni and community.
