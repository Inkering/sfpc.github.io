School for Poetic Computation’s Bootcamp introduces the foundations of coding to beginners by creating visual art and animations in openFrameworks. This 5 session class will now be open to online participation for the first time and we welcome anyone who wants to learn to code. The bootcamp will be taught by Robby Kraft with teaching assistance from Ilona Brand and Zachary Lieberman.  

Students will be coding in C++, learning concepts like variables, memory, and scope; branching, looping, boolean evaluations, and logic; functions, recursion, and events; object-oriented design; and working with media like video, sound, and responding to keyboard and mouse inputs. Students will become competent in Xcode/Visual Studio, GitHub, and openFrameworks.

### Who are the teachers?
- [Robby Kraft](http://robbykraft.com/), Teacher - is an origami artist, educator, and software engineer based in New York City.
- [Ilona Brand](https://theilonabrand.com/), Teaching Assistant - is a freelance tech generalist building technology to empower communities.
- [Zach Lieberman](http://zach.li/), Visiting Teacher - is a new media artist, designer, computer programmer, and educator.

### How will the class be conducted?
We will conduct the class online via Zoom between 1 - 3 pm EST on Tuesday's and Thursdays. Teachers and TA's will be available at dedicated hours through the week for individual questions and discussion.

In addition to online classes and one-on-ones, we will be using Slack for communication, GitHub for sharing course material, Google calendar to stay organized and Calend.ly to schedule one-on-ones.
