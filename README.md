# sfpc.io

## Github based development
You can create or edit pages directly on Github, and after you make your commit to master, that change will automatically be deployed to sfpc.io. No need to setup jekyll on your local machine!

## Local Development

1. Install ruby, bundler, and github-pages. Detailed instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/).
2. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
3. Visit http://localhost:4000

## Notes

- Maximum content width: `1140px`. (Good to keep in mind when preparing images for a full-width slideshow.)
