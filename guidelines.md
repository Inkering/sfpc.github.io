## Website Updates and Markdown Editing

*How to keep [sfpc.io](https://sfpc.io/) accessible*

### Image tagging

Perkins School for the Blind is a forefront resource on improving access and education for people who are blind. It's a great institution, and they have some advice for tagging:

Wherever a image provides editorial information or context for a post or article, it should get tagged with an "alt-tag." These are used when someone is using a slower internet connection, and, first and foremost, when a screen reader is active. Some simple guidelines for writing useful alt-tags:

1. Do: provide information about the literal content of the image
2. Don't: Say that it is a "Photo of ___", screen readers and browsers already know and indicate that it is an image, and people using readers are extremely efficient with them.
3. Decide: whether to provide implied context of the image. I think it usually isn't necessary, but if it is a complex art piece which is very challenging to describe in one or two sentences, it may be a good idea to add abstract meaning.

For someone who has the ability, writing image tags is usually as simple as if you looked at a picture and tried to describe it to someone next to you in one or two sentences. Think back to when you've done that during a phone call, for instance. Perkins doesn't recommend making the description hard to understand for the sake of accurately describing colors (e.g. [https://colors.lol/](https://colors.lol/).) Instead, it's usually best to focus on the subject matter.

In the sfpc website when editing a page, the markdown for alternative text looks like this (where the highlighted region is the alt-text.

### Logotype images versus textuals

Whenever possible, format titles, text, etc as actual text rather than logo type or poster images. Posters which have information such as dates, times, and locations should have the text repeated in the article.

### Contrast in graphics

For photography this isn't such a concern, but for graphics and especially important ones, keeping the contrast high (avoiding hard to see colors) is a good idea.

It's possible to check and quantify contrast, and many websites exist to help confirm. For instance these ones work well:

## General Examples

ðŸ˜Ša-ok! â†’  "Blue hydrangea flowers soon after rain"

ðŸ˜¤functional, but too simple to be pleasantâ†’ "Flowers"

ðŸ˜¬ too long â†’ "photo of light lavender hydrangea flowers after a recent rain set against a mottled concrete background, with 25 leaves present, and a small bite out of one leaf which could have been from a dog, but alternatively could have been a cute bug"

## Social Media

*Communicating with the outside net*

### Blogging // Medium Posts

*Adding care to editorial systems*

Largely, the Medium design team has this covered. Just make sure to add alternative text.

In the Medium editor, hovering over an image presents this view. Make sure to add a caption AND some alternative text. These serve different purposes.

When posting, an example situation might look like this. Although Instagram uses machine learning to infer the contents of images and provide automatic alternative text, doing it manually will be much more usable for folks and far more accurate.
