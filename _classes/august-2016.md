description: Instead of coding from scratch, we will be remixing, modding and collaging existing technologies to critically explore them. We'll learn about the physical infrastructure of the internet, the underlying logic of programming languages and the code behind popular corporate web platforms. We will then use this knowledge to create playful projects that subvert these computational systems we use every day.
