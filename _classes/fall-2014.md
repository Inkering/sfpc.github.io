description: "The Fall 2014 session will, for the first time, focus on two areas of research which we are calling:new audiences and assistive technology. With new audiences, we will be trying to answer the question, “how can we spread what we care about far and wide and to diverse new groups?” Students focused on this track will be engaged in teaching and designing tools, systems, and approaches to help bring poetic computation to far flung places and communities. With assistive technology, we will examine how computation and artistic works can be enabling forces, helping people overcome challenges, and offering new means of communication and expression. SFPC will be partnering with several institutions and individuals in the NYC area to explore and refine these approaches.
