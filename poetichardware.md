### Poetic Hardware 

Date: Starting in June 17th 2020 for ten weeks

Teachers: CW&T (Che-Wei Wang + Taylor Levy), Tiri Kananuruk and Sebastian Morales

[Application](https://airtable.com/shrPsncfUrezichzK) is now open 

​​In *Poetic Hardware* we learn computational hardware as a way to engage with the physical world and broaden our creative practices. This 10-week online curriculum is supported by a custom electronics learning kit intended for beginners to learn about analog + digital electronics, a programmable micro-controller, sensors and mechanisms through a lens of legibility and thoughtful exploration.
​​
​​Beginning with discrete electronic components such as resistors, LEDs and transistors, and then moving to integrated circuits, Arduino , sensors, motors, mechanisms and building physical things, our focus is on connecting with the physical nature, system, rules and materiality of electronics + hardware. We address electronics as human-scale objects, which we can see, shape and manipulate in a circuit. With an emphasis on legibility, we dissolve the microscopic abstractions and systems, which are usually obscured in conventional technology products and re-establish our relationship to technology.
​​
​​Through instructor-led tutorials, modular circuits and creative hands-on prompts, we will create custom electronics with our hands and gain access to electronic production tools that are normally reserved for mass production. By the end of the course, expect to have a working familiarity with basic analog and digital electronics, and the confidence to begin to apply computational tools to our creative practices.

​​
​​The Poetic Hardware class is taught by CW&T (Che-Wei Wang + Taylor Levy), Tiri Kananuruk and Sebastian Morales. The curriculum is developed by the teachers and Taeyoon Choi of School for Poetic Computation.

### ​​Expectations and requirements 
​​
​​Through weekly lectures, individual meetings with teachers, hands on activities, tutorials and project shares, we will work through a mix of open ended assignments, poetic prompts and technical challenges. These may include creating a simple Input/Output system, building a playful button or cardboard mechanism, or even creating something seemingly non-technical. We will use everyday tools and materials we can easily work with in our homes. Think soldering iron, cardboard, rubber bands and hot glue! We will also learn how to build + order a PCB (printed circuit board) from scratch and order components.
​​
​​Weekly lectures are accompanied by custom electronic kits. Kits are intended as “physical lecture notes”, a way to engage more closely with the course material and to provide a modular and accessible starting points for future projects. 
​​
​​An important part of this class will be virtual 1-on-1 instructor + TA meetings. These are meant to help guide your creative practice with this new material. Even though there is a technical component to this class, our primary goal as educators is to empower your creative practice. 
​​
*​​There are no technical requirements for this class.*
​​
​​Whether you come as a seasoned electrical engineer or someone who has never touched a wire, come to class ready to get your hands dirty, to support your peers, to get frustrated and to freely work with computation as physical material in new and unfamiliar ways.
​​
### Syllabus

- Welcome class. Hardware in a home. (Studio tour, survey of tools we use, materials, fabrication possibilities).
- Intro to circuit. Power, ground, control, resistance.
- Electronic control. The transistor + logic.
- Calculator/clock/time based circuits/seven segment…
- Building an Arduino from scratch.
- Analog input (sensors)
- Motors + mechanisms

​### Hear from the students

"CW&T's hardware class made me remember how much I love making things—how the devices around us are not inaccessible works of magic, but human objects that are discernible. It made be believe I could figure out how to build anything, and that the line between engineering and art could be blurred completely. Che-Wei and Taylor both teach with kindness, openness, and joy. It's infectious and genuine, as is their interest in student work. I loved learning about not only their individual perspectives and practices, but their partnership. That important reminder that we need not always toil alone.” - Maxwell Neely-Cohen

​​“CW&T's hardware and electronics class started with the simplest definition of a machine, and had us re-examine each piece as we built it up so that at the end we not only understood the underlying technology but were able to draw inspiration from the inner workings of the hardware we chose for projects. The material can be difficult but through each step CW&T encouraged us to invest in the hardware challenges that inspired us, so each assignment led to a meaningful creation.” - Danny Garfield
​​
​​“I absolutely loved the hardware class at SFPC. I had never really dabbled in electronics prior to SFPC, and I cannot even begin to express how grateful I am to Taylor, Che-Wei, Tiri, and Seb for being such patient and helpful instructors. It was lovely to learn from instructors with such strong backgrounds in art and design, and I feel like I gained so much knowledge through them and through collaboration with such a diverse group of classmates. The class was super interactive, and it was amazing to experience such a hands-on deep dive into electronics and physical computing in such a sort period of time.” - Sonia Boller

### Meet the teachers

![](/static/img/poetichardware/cwandt.jpg) 

[CW&T](https://cwandt.com/) is the art and design practice of Che-Wei Wang & Taylor Levy. 

Che-Wei Wang [pron. sey-wey] is an artist, designer & architect with expertise in computational and generative design, fabrication technologies, electronics, CNC machining, and metal manufacturing. The results range from architecture & sculpture to interactive installations & mobile apps. He is the winner of the 2003 SOM fellowship and the Young Alumni Achievement Award from Pratt Institute. Che-Wei has taught courses on design, time, creative computing, and inflatables, at various institutions. He is an alumnus of MIT Media Lab, ITP at NYU, and Pratt Institute.

Taylor Levy [pron. tey-ler] is an artist & designer with a penchant for taking things apart, understanding how they work, and then putting them back together in a way that exposes their inner workings.The results take on a variety of forms from low-tech electronic sculpture to high-tech software & other executions. She has work on view at The Leonardo Museum of Science and Technology and was a resident at Fabrica Interactive in Treviso, Italy. She is an alumna of MIT Media Lab, ITP at NYU, and Vassar College.

### ​​I’m still not sure if I should take this class?!!?
​​
​​If you already have a clear electronics project in mind, like building a drone or a complex I.O.T. system, this may not be the right class for you. However, if you want to learn about electronics + hardware through the lens of poetry, self-expression and quirky thoughtfulness, we look forward to working a playing together.
