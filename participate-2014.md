## Fall 2014 Session

School for poetic computation(SFPC) will host an intensive ten weeks session in New York City from October 1st - Dec 12. SFPC is an ideal environment for students to develop and further a deep curiosity of what it means to work poetically in computational media.

SFPC is not a technical bootcamp. Rather, it is an opportunity to work intensively with a small group of faculty, visiting artists and peers to explore artistic freedom through computation. Computation is poetic when technology is used for critical thinking and aesthetic inquiry â€“ a space where logic meets electricity (hardware), math meets language (software) and analytical thinking meets creative experimentation. 

SFPC has held two successful sessions to date, a ten week course in Fall 2013 that culminated in an exhibition at <a href="http://eyebeam.org/">Eyebeam Art and Technology Center</a>, and two week session in Spring of 2014 held at <a href="http://orbitalnyc.com/">Orbital</a> in Lower East Side. 

The Fall 2014 and Spring 2015 sessions will, for the first time, focus on two areas of research which we are calling:new audiences and assistive technology.   
 
On new audiences, we will be trying to answer the question, "how can we spread what we care about far and wide and to diverse new groups?" Students focused on this track will be engaged in teaching and designing tools, systems, and approaches to help bring poetic computation to far flung places. 

On assistive technology, we will examine how computation and artistic works can be enabling forces, helping people overcome challenges, and offering new means of communication and expression. SFPC will be partnering with several institutions and individuals in the NYC area to explore and refine these approaches. 

The idea behind these interconnected "tracks" is to build on SFPC's core curriculum by exploring the common ground which we can take the ideas developed in our classroom space into the streets. We see them as platforms to help promote fearless prototyping, asking difficult questions and creating projects that embody issues that are not yet commonly addressed in the art / tech world.

**Who is going to teach?**

<a href="http://thesystemis.com/">Zachary Lieberman</a>, <a href="http://taeyoonchoi.com">Taeyoon Choi</a>, <a href="http://tegabrain.com">Tega Brain</a>, <a href="nas.sr/">Ramsey Nasser</a>, <a href="www.allisonburtch.net/">Allison Burtch</a>, <a href="http://uncommonplaces.com/">Ida Benedetto</a>, <a href="http://www.pitaru.com">Amit Pitaru</a>, as well as a variety of other workshop leaders and visiting artists.  

**What will happen in ten weeks?**

* 15 participants in one session. 
* 24/7 access to work space at Orbital, 155 Rivington Street, in Manhattan's Lower East Side.

* Daily classes on programming, electronics, history and theory of computation with teachers. 
* Teachers supporting participants with technical, conceptual and artistic guidance.
* Workshops with visiting artists. 
* Visits to institutions, schools and art spaces.  
* Reading and discussion group.
* Weekly dinners with special guests. 
* Peer to peer collaboration is highly encouraged among participants.

**Who are we looking for?**

We are looking for participants from diverse backgrounds: artists, programmers, educators, writers and anyone with a passion for poetic computation. Our only expectation is that you are eager to experiment, can learn from failure, and come fully dedicated to this ten week experience. In the past, we have had students with diverse technical experiences and we were delighted to learn that everyone had something to learn from our classes and each other. A group of faculty leads a selection process that is based on applicant's answers to an application form, work samples, and short interviews. 

**How much is tuition?**

Two weeks program will cost $5000 USD. The tuition goes to paying for space, teachers and materials. We value transparency in finance.

**Deadline is August 8th, 2014**

Please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1qKQj3CJ9_TVD7iQjLaRyljEAIMMmI1pdDFfK2Bdtziw/viewform?pli=1&edit_requested=true"> **apply here!**</a> In the past, we received 60+ strong applications and this time will likely be competitive as well. We select participants based on work sample and application form. We expect to notify the applicants by August 15th. 

**What is School for poetic computation?**

SFPC is an alternative school for art and technology. We are striving to create a mode of education based on collaboration between faculty and students. By participating you will be actively shaping an emerging culture of open source and transparent education.
