## Spring 2014 Session

School for poetic computation(SFPC) will host an intensive ten weeks session in New York City from October 1st - Dec 12. SFPC is an ideal environment for students to develop and further a deep curiosity of what it means to work poetically in computational media.

SFPC is not a technical bootcamp. Rather, it is an opportunity to work intensively with a small group of faculty, visiting artists and peers to explore artistic freedom through computation. Computation is poetic when technology is used for critical thinking and aesthetic inquiry â€“ a space where logic meets electricity (hardware), math meets language (software) and analytical thinking meets creative experimentation. 

SFPC has held two successful sessions to date, a ten week course in Fall 2013 that culminated in an exhibition at <a href="http://eyebeam.org/">Eyebeam Art and Technology Center</a>, and two week session in Spring of 2014 held at <a href="http://orbitalnyc.com/">Orbital</a> in Lower East Side. 

The Fall 2014 / Spring 2015 sessions will have two new tracks of research - new audiences and assistive technology.   With the new audiences track, we will be trying to answer the question, "how can we spread what we care about far and wide and to new diverse audiences?" Students focused on this track will be engaged in teaching and designing tools / systems / approaches to help bring poetic computation to far flung places. With the assistive technology track, we will examine how computation and artistic works can be enabling forces, helping people overcome challenges and offer people new means of communicating and expression.  SFPC will be partnering with several institutions in the metro NYC area to explore and refine these approaches. The idea behind these tracks is not to diminish from the core curriculum but to offer specific spaces for engagement and to take ideas developed in the classroom space out to the streets. We see them as platforms to help promote fearless prototyping, asking difficult questions and creating projects that embody issues that are not yet commonly addressed in the tech / art world.

Feel free to reach out to us if you have questions about the school: info@sfpc.io

**Who are we looking for?**

We are looking for participants from diverse backgrounds: artists, programmers, educators, writers and anyone with a passion for poetic computation. Our only expectation is that you are eager to experiment, can learn from failure, and come fully dedicated to this ten week experience. In the past, we had students with diverse technical experience and we were delighted to learn that everyone had something to learn from our classes and each other. A group of faculty lead a selection process that is based on applicant's answers in the application form, work samples and short interviews. 

**How much is tuition?**

Two weeks program will cost 5000 USD. The tuition goes to paying for space, teachers and materials. We value transparency in finance.

**Deadline is August 8th, 2014**

Please apply here! In the past, we received 60+ strong applications and we assume this time will be competitive as well. We select participants based on work sample and application form. We will notify the applicants by August 15th. 

**What is School for poetic computation?**

SFPC is an alternative model for art and technology education. We are striving to create a new kind of school through collaboration between faculty and students. By participating you will be actively shaping an emerging culture of open source and transparent education.
