## Call for Students: Code Paper Scissors

- Two-Week Session, Monday February 4th - Sunday February 17th, 2019
- SFPC, 155 Bank street, West Village, NYC
- 6:30pm - 9:30pm, Evening Classes
- [**Apply now!**](https://airtable.com/shrQBGNmSqYLK6q1p) competitive rolling admissions

How can we reimagine technology through paper? Lead by paper engineer/designer Kelli Anderson and origami artist/developer Robby Kraft, SFPC's two-week session will explore the wide variety of ways that a piece of paper can produce function.

When we fold, we imbue an inert material with pattern, structure, animation, function, and interface. Folded structures give us a means to touch and manipulate difficult problems—offering an inroad for applying physical intuition to abstractions. Folded systems scale: They may be shrunken-down for nanotech applications or up to scale of spacecraft. Physical prototyping offers a nimble back-and-forth between digital and physical realms, allowing ideas to be quickly tested against physical forces.

### Course objectives include:

- Using paper to give physical form to abstract concepts and make invisible forces in the world tangible and produce function
- A deep dive into origami design, including classical and modern computational design
- Learn how folding can be used to augment or replace traditional engineering methods
- An introduction to prototyping methods, equipment, code-based modeling and testing strategies
- An introduction to silkscreened electronics

Students will have access to resources and mentorship by leading practitioners in the field to create ambitious paper projects. We want to encourage students to invent new folding-as-tech projects that no one has seen before or reinvent ancient techniques anew with software and hardware. No prior coding or craft experience is necessary. Admissions is based on essay and previous work samples. Our work will be showcased on the final class on 2.17.

### Who are the teachers?
- [**Kelli Anderson**](http://kellianderson.com/) (*Co-Organizer*) - Kelli Anderson is a designer/paper engineer who draws, photographs, cuts, prints, codes, and creates stop-motion videos. She is also known for her work for NPR, The New Yorker, Wired, and MoMA—as well as branding/space redesigns for Russ & Daughters and momofuku. Her books, This Book Is a Planetarium and This Book is a Camera, are collections of functional pop-up contraptions that elucidate scientific principles in tactile terms.
- [**Robby Kraft**](https://www.robbykraft.com/) (*Co-Organizer, On-Site Support*) - Robby is an origami artist, creative engineer, instructor, and toolmaker. He's the creator of Rabbit Ear, the origami software design tool, and is proficient in all disciplines of origami including design, mathematics and software simulation, and rigid folding and thick materials. 
- [**Simon Azripe**](https://www.pratt.edu/faculty_and_staff/bio/?id=sarizpe) - Simon is a paper engineer and illustrator. His pop-up book work has received the Award of Excellence from the Society of Illustrators and the Museum of Comic Book Art and Cartooning. The Smithsonian's Cooper-Hewitt Design Museum Library and the Columbia University Library have acquired his work for their rare book collections.
- [**Pam Liou**](http://pamelaliou.com/) - Pam is a computational designer and writer living in Brooklyn, NY. Her work examines tensions between craftsmanship, technology and commerce, revealing the hidden sociopolitical infrastructures undergirding human industry. Her research centers around recoupling the consumer with the producer through design literacy and mass customization, fostering intimacy and efficacy through a dialectical creation process.
- [**Coralie Gourguechon**](https://www.coraliegourguechon.fr/) - Coralie Gourguechon is a designer and a paper electronics maker. Her projects aim to to demystify electronics by simplifying the execution of simple circuits in a graphical way and using paper.
- [**Taeyoon Choi**](http://taeyoonchoi.com/) (*Session Advisor*) - Taeyoon is an artist, a co-founder of School for Poetic Computation, an adjunct professor at NYU ITP and a former fellow at Data and Society. In 2018, Taeyoon is working on Distributed Web of Care and ongoing research with a critical perspective towards technology, ethics, justice and sensitivity to the concept of personhood.

- 10 class days in total with a final presentation. More teachers and speakers to be announced!

### What will happen in these two weeks?
Classes are held in the evenings Monday-Friday from 6:30-9:30pm, 2019. SFPC space will be open for students on weekdays between 4pm-6pm. The session will culminate in a party on the evening of Sunday February 27th, where students can invite their friends and present their favorite projects.

Students will have full access to the space during open hours for the three weeks of the session to work on projects between classes and mentors will be readily available for technical, conceptual, and artistic guidance.

### How do I apply?
[**Apply now!**](https://airtable.com/shrQBGNmSqYLK6q1p)

We accept up to 18 students on a rolling basis. We will respond to your application within 3 weeks of submission. Rolling admissions means there are fewer and fewer slots the longer you wait, so if you’re interested in the program get your application in early!

### How competitive is the admissions?

SFPC admissions is highly competitive. Every session, we receive up to 80 applicants and select 18. We focus on creating diversity among our student body. We work with a group of alumni and teachers to review and select students based on their work samples and essays.  

### How much is tuition?

$2,000 USD for the 2-week program. You’ll also need to cover your own cost of living, including housing and meals (recent alumni report this to be in the range of $500 - $900). Upon acceptance, payment of full tuition, your space in the class will be reserved. SFPC tuition goes directly to paying for the teachers, organizers, materials and space that make sessions like this possible.

### Do you offer scholarship?

We are completely self-funded, which dramatically limits our ability to offer scholarships. In Code Societies, we are offering two work-study opportunity to a qualified applicant who would be expected to work 10 hrs/week in exchange for a 50% reduction of tuition.  We’re particularly looking out for women, people of color, disabled person, people under-represented in the field of art + technology, and those with financial need.

Please note that if you apply for work study, we will consider your application separately from the general admissions applications, since we have little flexibility regarding scholarships. This is for people who absolutely need assistance to participate in SFPC. Occasionally, students have received support from cultural foundations, schools or current employers and we are happy to provide supporting materials as proof of acceptance.  

### Cancellation and refund policy

- If you are accepted and need to cancel, we can give you 100% refund up to January 15th, 2019.
- 50% refund between January 15th – January 31st, 2019.
- 25% refund between February 1st – February 4th, 2019.
- No refunds can be given after the first day of class.
- Participation is not transferrable to another person.

### What is expected of me?

- Come to all classes and thoughtfully engage with your classmates and teachers.
- We are looking for autodidacts from all backgrounds who are curious, generous and open.
- We welcome students with a broad array of technical experiences–no coding experience is required, but a basic comfort level with technology is preferred.
- B.Y.O.Laptop (Mac / PC / Linux)

### Where is SFPC?

We are located in 155 Bank street, in the courtyard of the Westbeth Artists Community in the West Village, New York City.
