Rachel is an artist and organiser working with diverse tech communities in Europe to create educational opportunities for those interested in learning to make and to code.

Her background is in audio engineering and visual effects and for her the logical next step is moving into programming apps and interactive installation work to make visual effects happen "in the real world".  

Having previously worked with social justice groups, she feels compelled to help make the tech world less daunting and more diverse and inclusive. Among other projects, she is currently working closely with groups such as [OpenTechSchool](http://www.opentechschool.org/berlin/) in Berlin, Germany, where she resides, to realise their next dream: creating a hacker school! Stay tuned.
