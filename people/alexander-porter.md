Alexander Porter is an experimental photographer exploring visual documentation. He brings a persistent admiration for photographic traditions and history to new imaging techniques. He is a part of the team behind the DepthKit (formerly RGBDToolkit), a hybrid process for creating cinematic imagery with commercially available depth sensors. His current interest is in understanding the impacts of computational photography on our world and repurposing esoteric scanning techniques for public use.
