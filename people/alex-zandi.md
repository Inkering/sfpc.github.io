Alex Zandi is an artist and designer whose work examines cybernetic structures and the chimeras that underpin the architecture of these systems. Utilizing language from experimental video, design, and modernist literature, Alex assembles a poetic that reframes the ever-evolving intersection between technology and media. Alex studied Communication Design and English Literature at Washington University in St. Louis. He currently lives and works in Brooklyn, New York.
