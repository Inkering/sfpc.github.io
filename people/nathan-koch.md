Nathan Koch is a coder, electronic music producer, and live visualist from Chicago. He spends his days as a creative technologist at Cramer-Krasselt, an independent ad agency based in Chicago, but most nights end with him surrounded by drum machines in a darkened room. Heâ€™s currently exploring using the Raspberry Pi in conjunction with a collection of old and new sequencers and drum machines to make an entirely live audiovisual performance without relying on a traditional laptop.
