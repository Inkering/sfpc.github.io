Zach is an artist with a simple goal: he wants you surprised. His work uses technology in a playful way to break down the fragile boundary between the visible and the invisible. He has held residencies at Ars Electronica Futurelab, Eyebeam, Dance Theater Workshop, and the Hangar Center for the Arts in Barcelona, and his work has been exhibited around the world.

Zach is one of the co-founders of openFrameworks, a C++ library for creative coding. He’s currently working on the EyeWriter project, a low-cost, open source hardware and software toolkit that helps people draw with their eyes. The project has won the Design of the Year from the London Design Museum, FutureEverything prize and the Golden Nica in Interactive Art at Ars Electronica. It was also listed by Time Magazine as one the 50 best inventions in 2010. Zach is one of the recipients of the AOL 25 for 25 grant, and was listed in Fast Company Magazine’s 100 Creative people in business. He taught at Parsons School of Design for over 10 years before helping start SFPC.
