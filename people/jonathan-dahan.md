Jonathan Dahan is a hacker of computation machinations, interactive experiences, and electroacoustics. He likes exploring the boundaries of private and public space, and generally causing (mostly harmless) c̉̊haos in an attempt to cause a fracture in people's otherwise regular days.

Currently working in the Media Lab at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, he helps to empower modern artists to work on their craft, and explore cultural heritage.
