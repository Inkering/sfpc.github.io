Jen is an independent data scientist and data communicator. She teaches Math for Artists at NYU ITP, runs private data workshops, and crunches numbers for clients. Jen was previously a researcher in the Spatial Information Design Lab at Columbia University. She's spoken at SXSW and Eyeo, and contributed ideas at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Her research, writing, and speaking explore the promises and implications of data and technology in society. Her education is in applied math and information science. Often oppositional, she's always on the side of love. These are her favorite poems today.
