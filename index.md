<p class="intro-info intro-1"><b>school for poetic computation</b> is an artist run school in New York that was founded in 2013. A small group of students and faculty work closely to explore the intersections of code, design, hardware and theory -- focusing especially on artistic intervention. It's a hybrid of a school, residency and research group. <br><br> <span class="motto">Our motto is: more poetry, less demo.</span></p>
