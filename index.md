<p id="paragraph-test">School for Poetic Computation is an artist run school in New York that was founded in 2013. A small group of students and faculty work closely to explore the intersections of code, design, hardware and theory -- focusing especially on artistic intervention. It's a hybrid of residency and research group that happen in different length and multiple times per year. Our motto is: more poems less demos. We are now calling for students in new two weeks program starting in May of 2014.</p>
