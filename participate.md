## Summer 2018 Call is Open Now!
### Code Societies
#### Three Weeks - Evening Classes
<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">Learn more about, and apply to Code Societies <a href="/codesocieties/">here</a>.
</div>
- Monday July 2nd - Saturday July 21st
- @ SFPC, 155 Bank street, West Village, NYC
- 6:30pm - 9:30pm, Evening Classes

<a href="/codesocieties/">Code Societies</a> will examine the ideological and mythological attributes of computation, concentrating on the poetics and politics of culturally embedded software.
How do different platforms and processes — including algorithms, data collection, social media, networks, simulation, and ritual — yield distinct modes of seeing, thinking, and feeling, structure social organization, and reinforce existing systems of power? Through a balanced study of critical theory and hands-on making workshops, students will create several small projects that explore and question these ideas. Students will be introduced to Python and discover poetic, playful, and powerful ways to use computation. All levels of programming ability welcome and an enthusiastic willingness to reconsider how code shapes and is shaped by society required!

- Location: SFPC, 155 Bank street, West Village, NYC

Join SFPC's main program for ten weeks in New York City. Daily classes that range from programming, electronics, and the history and theory of art and technology. There are student-led skill sharing sessions, lectures and workshops with visiting artists, visits to institutions, schools, art spaces and dinners with special guests.


Subscribe to our mailing list at the bottom of this page for enrollment announcements.

We are also offering a variety of workshops and conferences in Spring/Summer 2018. Please check [our blog](http://blog.sfpc.io) for the latest information.

## Learning to Teach Conference 2018


[Learning to Teach](https://medium.com/@sfpc/learning-to-teach-2018-4dca068b0fb8) is a day-long conference for educators teaching computation in creative fields like art, design or digital humanities departments. Led by Taeyoon Choi (SFPC) and Tega Brain (NYU), the conference will feature keynotes by leading educators including Daniel Shiffman, Naomi Clark, Brad Garton. The keynote speakers will share their experiences teaching computer programming and related topics, their strategies for blending critical thinking, engineering, and inspiring creativity in a teaching environment. This year’s program will include a participatory session for attendees to observe the pedagogical strategies of their peers and develop teaching approaches of their own. Join us to explore the intersection of pedagogy and creative practice, and get ready for the year ahead.

- Date: January 20th, 2018 (10am ~ 5pm)
- Venue: Integrated Digital Media, NYU, 8th floor of 2 Metrotech Center. Brooklyn.

### What is the School for Poetic Computation?  

School for Poetic Computation (SFPC) is a hybrid of school, artist residency and research group where students develop a deep curiosity of what it means to work poetically in computational media. SFPC [began](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/12/code-to-joy-the-school-for-poetic-computation-opens/?_r=0) as a school run by artists for artists. In the past we have held a combinations of two-week and ten-week intensive sessions.

SFPC is not a technical bootcamp, it is an opportunity to work with a group of faculty, visiting artists, and peers to focus on exploring artistic practice through computation. Computation is poetic when technology is used for critical thinking and aesthetic inquiry – a space where logic meets electricity (hardware), math meets language (software) and analytical thinking meets creative experimentation (theory).

[This article](http://www.creativeapplications.net/education/teaching-and-learning-at-sfpc-conversation-with-allison-parrish-and-surya-mattu/) featuring two teachers provides more insight on what teaching and learning feels like at SFPC or you can check out some of the student's blogs from previous sessions: [Yeseul](http://ysfpc.tumblr.com), [Chris](http://sfpchris.tumblr.com/), [Toru](http://sfpctoruurakawa.tumblr.com/), [Andy](http://sfpc-amd.tumblr.com/), [Sarah](http://sarahgp.com/writings/sfpc/other-two-questions.html) and [Robby](http://robbykraft.com/sfpc/).  Finally, our [FAQ](http://sfpc.io/faq/).

### Who are we looking for?

We are looking for autodidacts from all backgrounds who are curious, generous and open. Anyone with a passion to explore poetic computation is invited and celebrate diversity in all forms. We expect that you are eager to experiment, learn from failure and come fully dedicated to this ten week experience meaning you will commit to engage with SFPC full-time.

In the past, we have had students with a broad array of technical experiences and we were delighted, though unsurprised, that everyone had something to learn from each other. A group of faculty leads a selection process that is based on applicant’s answers to an application form, work samples, and short interviews. Upon acceptance, a selection of reading and prep work will be assigned to you to complete prior to attending SFPC.

### What is expected of me?

Acceptance into the session is an invitation to join the SFPC community. Full-time participation during the ten weeks is mandatory. This also means you come prepared to all of the classes, do the homework, and engage with the community. We expect our students to be in the school between 10am~5pm, Monday to Friday.

It’s also expected that you work openly – sharing what you learn along the way and collaborate with your peers. The success of the session for the group is dependent on engaged participation throughout the term. By participating you will be actively shaping an emerging culture of open source and transparent education.

### What are classes like?

SFPC’s main program takes place over ten weeks in New York City with daily classes that range from programming, electronics, and the history and theory of art and technology. There are student-led skill sharing sessions, lectures and workshops with visiting artists, visits to institutions, schools, art spaces and dinners with special guests.

We select up to 18 participants a session. Classes vary in length and are usually held Monday-Friday between 10am and 5pm. Students have full access to the space to work on projects between classes with teachers and mentors readily available for technical, conceptual, and artistic guidance. Peer to peer collaboration is highly encouraged among participant. We celebrate with a final student showcase where students get to share their projects with the larger SFPC community.


SFPC classes are typically structured around the following concepts: Computation and artistic practice, Language design as creative practice, Electronics and physical computing, Theory and philosophy for technology, and Code Poetry (Electronic literature and generatie poetry). The idea behind these interconnected topics is to build on SFPC’s core curriculum by exploring common ground where we can take the ideas developed in our classroom into the streets and studio. Check out [Call for Spring 2018](https://sfpc.io/spring2018) for a full listing of classes.  

### How can I help SFPC?

We are actively seeking private, corporate and institutional support to open our door to more diverse students. If you are interested in sponsoring a student, email <info@sfpc.io>. We are able to receive tax-deductible donations through our fiscal sponsor.

### Where is SFPC?
We are located in 155 Bank street, in the courtyard of the Westbeth Artists Community in the West Village, New York City.
