  testimonial: "If you think SFPC is what you think, that will be wrong. SFPC is a space for a group of people who badly want to try something new. They never tried it and probably will never try it again. SFPC will become a spirit embedded in your blood which makes you think things with a different angle, just like its motto: more poetry, less demo."

  testimonial: "I learned a lot at SFPC. I got the opportunity to work with extremely impressive people from diverse backgrounds and amazing teachers like Taeyoon Choi, Tega Brain, Kyle McDonald, Lauren McCarthy, Jonathan Dahan, and Zachary Lieberman. It was only a 2 week program last time, but I learned many things from other participants and got the chance to explore and fail freely. SFPC helped me to reshape the way I think. It's your turn."

  testimonial: "School For Poetic Computation is equal parts The Factory, childhood blanket fort, and mad scientist's lab. I learned a ton from the teachers and the whole SFPC community in a huge collaborative and exploratory environment."

  testimonial: "Attending SFPC is like walking into an all day buffet supplied with food from hyper-talented chefs. There's more than you could ever consume, naturally, and you will most likely find yourself requiring a digestion period, but holy crap is it tasty."
