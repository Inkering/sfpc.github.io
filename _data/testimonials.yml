  testimonial: "If you think SFPC is what you think, that will be wrong. SFPC is a space for a group of people who badly want to try something new. They never tried it and probably will never try it again. SFPC will become a spirit embedded in your blood which makes you think things with a different angle, just like its motto: more poetry, less demo."

  testimonial: "I learned a lot at SFPC. I got the opportunity to work with extremely impressive people from diverse backgrounds and amazing teachers like Taeyoon Choi, Tega Brain, Kyle McDonald, Lauren McCarthy, Jonathan Dahan, and Zachary Lieberman. It was only a 2 week program last time, but I learned many things from other participants and got the chance to explore and fail freely. SFPC helped me to reshape the way I think. It's your turn."

  testimonial: "School For Poetic Computation is equal parts The Factory, childhood blanket fort, and mad scientist's lab. I learned a ton from the teachers and the whole SFPC community in a huge collaborative and exploratory environment."
- name: Daniel Wilson
  testimonial: "Attending SFPC is like walking into an all day buffet supplied with food from hyper-talented chefs. There's more than you could ever consume, naturally, and you will most likely find yourself requiring a digestion period, but holy crap is it tasty."

  testimonial: "My takeaway from SFPC: Never settle for code that isn't at least a little bit magic"
- name: Scott Leinweber
  testimonial: "In SFPC I found a great community and it gave me the confidence to take on coding projects I couldn't have done before. Totally true, the people were great, the projects were fun, and shortly after I started a data viz project for a client I never would have gone after before, using python, processing, d3js, etc.. SFPC's also influenced my teaching work, and I'm starting to develop the curriculum for a [parametric] fabrication class"
- name: Andrew Kleindolph
  testimonial: "SFPC is a welcoming environment that mixes individuals from a variety of backgrounds, in a beautiful Lower East Side space, to think about and work on beautiful and esoteric sketches with computers, programming, and circuits. The program oscillates its focus between technique, concept, context, art and design. A huge variety of guests compliment the diverse pedagogical methods and interests of the core instructors. I learned so much and had such a great time."
