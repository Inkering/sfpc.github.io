Riley hopes you’re having a good day so far. He just woke up and is deleting promo emails on his phone. Later, he will make some tea and do dishes. The faucet is a little drippy so he’ll fiddle with that. Riley has a background in design and electrical engineering and wrote software for Khan Academy before joining SFPC.
