Syd is a barista and radical trans layabout generally interested in all things sociolinguistics. Their research is particularly focused on text--writing systems and their digital inputs, multilingual landscapes, literature and politics, gender and sexting--but are ironically not great at writing about it (yet). Mostly making illustrations and looping gifs, they hope their work is equal parts unsettling, informative, indulgent and playful.
