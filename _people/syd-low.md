Syd is a recovering ex-barista and radical trans layabout enamored with the ocean. Coming from a background in linguistics, their interests include localized discourses of power and identity, literatureâ€™s role in political history, and writing systems and their digital input interfaces. Mostly making illustrations and looping gifs, they hope their work is equal parts unsettling, informative, indulgent and playful.
