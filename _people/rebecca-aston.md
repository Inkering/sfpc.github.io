Rebecca Aston is a Zimbabwean artist, currently based in New York City. She re-imagines ownership of spaces, objects and memory in the territory that bridges virtual and physical space. Concerned with interaction, immersion and perception she draws inspiration from architectural, gaming and sculptural installation practices. She works across a range of media and technologies, making moving image pieces that are generated using 3D technologies, code, paint and video.
