Katie Rose Pipkin is a visual artist working across media. Her work deals with fragments, remnants, memory, and detritus. Fundamentally, her work involves time, both on a micro- and macrocosmic scale. She makes drawings with her hands, the internet, and sometimes her words. She is interested in working along the fault lines.
