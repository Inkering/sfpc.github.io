Le studied computer science and human-computer interaction at Carnegie Mellon, and is currently working on web frontend for Google+. She spent most of her life in the baby-small state of Delaware but has also lived in Chicago, Pittsburgh, London, and now San Francisco. She enjoys learning how to make things, both physical and digital. [Here](http://www.buttgenerator.com/) is the silliest project she's worked on this year.
