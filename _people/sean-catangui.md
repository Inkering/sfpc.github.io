Informed by his experiences as a musician, designer, and software developer, Sean works to push the limits of computation as an artistic medium. His most recent work explores the concept of ephemeral art. Aesthetically inspired by the work of KAWS, Wassily Kandinsky, and Leta Sobierajski, and conceptually inspired by jazz and hip hop, he hopes to push his art to occupy the space between the visual and the musical. Sean is from South Dakota and lives in Brooklyn. He works as a freelance designer and developer, and his hobbies include dancing and playing the piano.
