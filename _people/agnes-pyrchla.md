Agnes is a researcher and strategist who spends most of her time asking questions and learning about humans (in an effort to create thoughtful products). The most beautiful part of her process is finding patterns across seemingly disparate subjects. She is excited to learn a creative medium beyond lens and language to explore our relationship with the natural world.
