I am an artist, working mostly with new technology, but very passionate of other mediums, I love drawing, sculpting and exploring different instruments.
I work in an atelier in south Hamburg where I share my space with other artists like me.
My artistic work is concerned with exploration and expression, I try to give voice to part of the self inherently present in humans; though I think that certain places, cultural movements and situations have as well their own discoverable self, my work is looking for it and giving it a voice.
