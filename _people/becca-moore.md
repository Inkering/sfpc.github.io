Becca Moore graduated in 2011 with a BFA in Printmaking/Photography from Washington University in Saint Louis. With a strong interest in Socially Engaged Art, she was actively making in the Saint Louis community from 2008 - 2014.  She was involved with a wide variety of film, photo, music, and community projects, including STLsloup a monthly soup dinner that crowd-funds arts and community impact projects in St. Louis, MO. In her downtime she was in a light-hearted all-girl garage band. Becca currently assists the Nashville-based arts collective, Queen Avenue Arts with their quarterly Art + Tech event called Future Night.
