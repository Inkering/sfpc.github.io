Yumi is a motion designer and 3D modeler who has made animations for interactive installations, simulations of robotic works, and 3D modelings for webGL.
Sometimes I set up projectors and operate projections.
I love to see people enjoy experiencing interactive installations.
I love sensors, and Iâ€™m interested in hardware lately, so I want to make installations myself using these kinds of things.
