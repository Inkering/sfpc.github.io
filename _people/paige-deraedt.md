Paige DeRaedt is taking on a career risk. Paint, pencil, sewing needles, and crotchet hooks are home in her hands. After attending the University of Michigan (Math and Stats, â€™13), Paige worked at a failed start up and is currently a Systems Analyst at Citrix. Upon volunteering at the 2013 Eyeo festival, Paige discovered her dream of combining her learned background with her creative passion. Since then, she has been exploring the world of creative coding and cat gifs.
