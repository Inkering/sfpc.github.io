Ed Bear is an American performing artist and engineer. His work with robotics, sound, video, transmission and collective improvisation investigates the questionable calibration of social relationships with material technology. As an educator and designer committed to an equitable, open source world, he researches and practices material reuse as a civil responsibility. He has toured extensively in North America and Europe as a musician and teacher. In 2009 and 2010 he received NSF and other funds to study e-waste streams as educational resources, software defined radio, and novel energy harvesting using ionic polymer metal composites. He is currently working with littleBits, Inc. to revolutionize modular electronics.
