Allison Chan is a transdisciplinary designer and artist based in Oakland, CA. Drawing upon a background in global south feminisms and a sensitivity to craft, her practice often centers emergent possibilities of community, belonging, and resilience. Lately, she spends a lot of time thinking about the geopolitics of diaspora, precarity, and care/care work. She is happiest when working together with kind and thoughtful people in pursuit of less harrowing, more liberating horizons.Â
