I am an information designer and media artist. My work connects detritus and the ephemeral, as represented by the mundane object and information systems. I write software as part of my creative process.

Since my first Apple ][e, code has been a method of exploration for interactive media, information design, and graphic language. My recent focus has included queer politics, WTC, financial data, visualization, and physicalized narrative.  I aim to take things off the screen and materialize them in forms and mediums.
