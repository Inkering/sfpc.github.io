Nahee really likes to code although computer programming is not her major or profession. She just wants to keep making something “interesting” using her autodidactic computation & graphic skills. She made several mobile or web applications dealing social issues in politics or sexuality. Recently, she is interested in designing poetic interactions with hardware hacking.
