Hyojin works in the intersection of art, design and technology. She investigates the liminal space between the visible world and those things that usually remain hidden by creating fictional objects and performance to expand a sense of reality. As artists and cultural producers she investigates how identity is constructed amidst specific cultural and social landscapes, and through her work aspires to shift or re-frame perspectives or ways of seeing.
