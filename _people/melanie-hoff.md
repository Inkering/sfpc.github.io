Melanie Hoff is an artist based in Brooklyn. Her practice investigates identity, visibility, and the ways in which appearances actively shape our interactions and consciousness. She uses technology and computation to play with systems that underlie contemporary society. She is interested in taking art out of the museum and into the processes of everyday life. Her previous work explored our relationship to technology and science by taking scientific processes and the aesthetics of the experiment as raw material. She studied sculpture, metalworking, and photography at Pratt institute and is currently a masters candidate at ITP. Her work has been featured on Radiolab, the Discovery Channel, and exhibited in galleries internationally.
