Kelli is an artist, designer and tinkerer who is always experimenting with new means of making images and experiences. She draws, photographs, prints, codes and creates a variety of designed things for herself and other. From interactive paper to layered, experimental website, everything begins and ends in her studio which houses a 191 letterpress and an assortment of other benevolent contraptions.
