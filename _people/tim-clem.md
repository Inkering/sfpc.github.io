I’m a programmer, educator, face-maker, and tinkerer who lives in Brooklyn with my partner and our two pet rats, Watermelon and Peanut. I’ve been programming since I was a kid, somehow. I think a lot about the future of software, cities, capitalism, education, and how I can contribute. I have a BS in Mathematics from American University in Washington, D.C. (of all places). I spent a bleak winter in a darkroom in Prague and the better part of a year on a commune in rural Virginia.

In recent years I’ve mainly been developing for iOS. The current generation of mobile devices represents an unprecedented shift in how we interact with technology. Software has never been so easy to use and create, and the possibilities are really freaking exciting.
