Katie Smillie is a California native living in Brooklyn. She had a brief career on political campaigns before joining the startup world as a researcher and product manager. She has taken a stab at time travel at dearfuture.me and enjoys building things that make people smile. 

Katie also appreciates opposing forces. She balances her competitive side as a runner with a spiritual yoga practice, healthy eating with periodic days of binging on donuts, and frugality with spontaneous travel.
