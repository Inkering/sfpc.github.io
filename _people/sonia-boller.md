Sonia Boller is a creative technologist passionate about creating immersive, interactive experiences. After discovering the power and flexibility of THREE.js she's been deeply interested in the relationship between audio input and visual output, and hopes to explore that correlation more and bring it into the physical space. She has spent the past year and a half working with non-profits to help them manage and visualize their data, and loves the idea of making complex data simpler through visualizations.
