Born and raised in Beijing, China, Sixing moved to Poughkeepsie, NY in 2014 to study some very broad and extremely curious subject called "media." She loves cd-roms that are too old to be read, videos that repeat the uneventfulness of everyday life, codes that react to our physical and emotional selves, words that start with "post-", accidental glitches, some bad tastes, and almost all cats. She make things that combine some, if not all, of them.
