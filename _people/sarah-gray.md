Sarah has been a professional software developer, working at companies large and small, since 2001. Prior to this, she created and directed experimental theater and got a Masters Degree from ITP at NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts. In 2016, she worked as an Engineering Manager on Hillary Clinton’s tech team; in 2017 she learned to program for the Ethereum blockchain; and she is currently taking time to focus on creative work and integration. Because of her dual background in coding and experimental performance, she is constantly looking at words and forms, and putting together new projects. She is extremely excited to spend ten weeks learning, collaborating, and deepening at SFPC.
