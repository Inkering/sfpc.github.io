I graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in Cognitive Science and am especially interested in consciousness, perception, and identity through an interdisciplinary lens. Originally from Colorado, I currently live in the Bay Area and am passionate about art, adventure, skiing, food systems, and the outdoors.
