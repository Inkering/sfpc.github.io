Jonathan Leung loves creating. His mission in life is to enable others–as well as himself–to freely discover what they want in their own lives and enable them to relentlessly pursue that. More recently, Jonathan was doing this work as a former founder of Hack Club, a teacher at All Star Code and General Assembly, an early lead organizer ofPennApps, as the original creator of the Learners’ House, and hacking on fun project. Jonathan also loves yogaing, beatboxing, meditating, and creating social experiences that take people out of their standard social “scripts”.
