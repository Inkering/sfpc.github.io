Kelly is a web developer by trade originally from the Bay Area and currently based in NYC. Her interests include hysterical coding, drawing, staring at data, useless hardware and amateur everything. She thinks a lot about things that address the conflict between what is considered “rational” and the absurd, and power systems particularly in relation to the tech industry. She has referred to herself alternately as an engineer, artist, creative technologist, and in this case the third person.
