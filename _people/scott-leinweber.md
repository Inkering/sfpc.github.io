Scott is an architectural designer exploring the perceptual digital-physical overlap of spaces today. Coming from an architectural background, his experience is rooted in parametric and computational design, digital fabrication, and building information modeling. With this digital craft knowledge, he seeks out interactive artists and physical computing projects to probe our digital relationships with physical space.
