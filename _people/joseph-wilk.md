I’m a programmer who works in sound design, musical composition tools, interactive 3D visuals, computer science education and performance art. I perform live coded musical and visual performances as Repl Electric. I’m interested in the relationships between sound & visuals, the illusions that give life, emotion and narrative to computer art and programming as an act of performance.
