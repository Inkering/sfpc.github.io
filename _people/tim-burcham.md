Tim is a product developer and creative coder based out of Colorado, leading a team at Markit Digital focused on finance, data and technology.  Creatively, he is inspired by endless geometry dreams he had as a child, massive datasets, futurist and brutalist architecture, and technology and art that bridges the gap between the physical and digital.  He has worked with film, music, generative geometry, video input, audio reactivity and sensor input in his creative work.
