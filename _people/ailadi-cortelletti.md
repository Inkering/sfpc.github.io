Ailadi is an Italian visual artist & designer based in Hong Kong. She loves anything that makes the eye flirt with the mind. She likes yearly dailyconstraints, blue Klein, blood red, 8-bit stuff, the “what if.. ”incipit, curvy shapes, exploring how to draw in different ways/mediums and seeing what comes out from collaborations with people from different backgrounds.
