Ingrid Burrington writes, makes maps, and tells jokes about places, politics, and the weird feelings people have about both. She's the author of Networks of New York: An Illustrated Field Guide to Urban Internet Infrastructure and has previously written for The Atlantic, e-flux journal, The Nation, and San Francisco Art Quarterly. She's currently an artist-in-residence at Data and Society Research Institute.
