Hello! My name is Roxanne and I'm a self-taught Product Designer, Creative Coder, and Illustrator currently splitting my time between Brooklyn, NY and in mini-lives around the world. Prior to digital nomading for almost two years to date as a Freelancer, I spent a year at a Startup and two in Corporate. When I'm not swimming in pixels or code, I love to speak in foreign language, stand on my head, photograph the beauty in life, and prepare beautiful meals with people.
