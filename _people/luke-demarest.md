Luke Demarest is a visual artist, researcher, and teacher based in London. His interactive installations and computationally generated sculptures and prints are informed by technical, theoretical, and historical perspectives. His work has been exhibited at the Victoria & Albert Museum and shortlisted for the Lumen Prize. His artist practice is currently supported by Arts Council England. Luke also collaborates with academic researchers to visually represent, explore, and explain complex systems that exhibit emergent behavior over time (e.g., international labour migration and modern slavery).
