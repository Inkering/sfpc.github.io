Max Fowler is a programmer and artist currently based in New York City. Some of his recent projects have explored the ways that we conceptualize space, expressive analysis of text message history and how to use a twitter bot to take out the trash. He is interested in using data visualization to explore subjectivity, generative poetry, and the ways we use technology to decide what to read. He also does freelance development and interaction design for startups.
