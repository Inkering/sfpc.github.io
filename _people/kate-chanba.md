I'm a designer and cartographer based in Brooklyn. Working with cities large and small, I enjoy creating graphics that enrich the experience of urban environments and offer a sense of place. I'm passionate about multimodal cities, comfortable bike routes, and proactive government. My gurus include Lance Wyman and Massimo Vignelli.
