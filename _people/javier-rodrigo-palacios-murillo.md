Rodrigo considers himself a big-picture generalist. 

He often thinks that a wider view helps find new relations of meaning and understanding that lead to new solutions.

As an artist, he's on the search for interconnectedness of existing things and for the search of new meanings. 

Technology is a medium that provides him that potential.  Producing hybrids of work that go from public art, to sculpture and the disclosure of new kinds of work. 

He lives and works in Mexico City
