I am working with technology in artistic or cultural contexts. Sometimes as an artist other times as a creative IT consultant, a designer, teacher or a maker. I love when what I do is something I can hold in my hands or it has a social or cultural impact. I work mostly with interactive or generative visual works manipulating light and pixels to play with people.
