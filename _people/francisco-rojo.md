Fran likes to make personally expressive videogames. He's recently been thinking a lot about community -- how and why groups of people come together and stay together. Today he bought a real book at a real bookstore and was only moderately anxious during the interaction. Later he will eat some leftover cold spaghetti from the fridge since he was too burnt out from the whole book extravaganza to go buy aluminum foil.
