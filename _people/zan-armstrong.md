I’m Zan.

I was born in St. Louis, studied at Williams College, directed the outdoors program at Double H camp, taught math at Chewonki Semester School in Maine, raced through the forests of Sweden orienteering while studying bioinformatics, analyzed data and forecasted revenue at Google, developed a new charting style to visualize Simpson’s paradox, and am now studying at the School for Poetic Computation.
