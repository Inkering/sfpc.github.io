Agustín is an Electronic Artist and creative coder that enjoys exploring the fields of New Media, artistic abstraction and visual composition.

With a background in 3D Animation and graphic design, he is interested in creating installations and software with an emphasis in the visuals, constantly discovering new areas and subjects to explore, still fascinated by the expressive power of code and the poetry hidden in algorithmic thinking.

He is a self-taught coder that recently finished attending classes at the Master in Technology and Aesthetics of Electronics Arts, at UNTREF Buenos Aires, Argentina.

In parallel, he relishes in the composition of soundScapes and sound experimentation.
