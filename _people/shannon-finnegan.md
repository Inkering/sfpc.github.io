I am an artist making work about disability culture and access. My work is often intended specifically for a disabled audience and reflects the humor, vibrance, and nuance of our community. I’ve done projects with The Invisible Dog and the Wassaic Project, and am working on a new project with Friends of the High Line. In 2018, I received a Wynn Newhouse Award and participated in Art Beyond Sight’s Art + Disability Residency. In 2019, I will be a resident at Eyebeam.
