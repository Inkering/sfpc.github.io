## Uncomputable


According to digital philosophers, the world is a computer and everything inside it is computable. But is this entirely true? What about things that fall outside the bounds of the computable? Alan Turing demonstrated that there are kinds of problems that are computable and kinds of problems that are not, providing a theoretical answer to the question of the uncomputable. But there is also a practical answer: how many computer cycles do you have at your disposal? If you want to crack high-grade encryption, can you afford to crunch the numbers until the sun burns out? In this project we will explore the realm of the uncomputable. In the digital realm the uncomputable appears in logical paradoxes and rational incompleteness. In the analog realm the uncomputable consists of all those things that remain ungovernable, unspeakable, or unseeable. Come explore with us the binary present, and the non-binary future. Come explore the uncomputable.

Uncomputable consists of lectures by Alexander R. Galloway on June 21st and June 28th, 6~9pm and an exhibition by Taeyoon Choi that will be open to the public between June 21st and 28th. Uncomputable is free, please [apply](https://airtable.com/shreKLUM5BDyu2zMi) for the lectures as seating is limited. Uncomputable is made possible with the support of The Department of Media, Culture, and Communication at New York University and the School for Poetic Computation.
