## Call for Students: Code Societies
- Three-Week Session, Monday July 2th - Saturday July 21st
- @ SFPC, 155 Bank street, West Village, NYC
- 6:30pm - 9:30pm, Evening Classes
- Apply [**here!**](xx)


SFPC's Summer Intensive, Code Societies will examine the ideological and mythological attributes of computation, concentrating on the poetics and politics of culturally embedded software.
How do different platforms and processes — including algorithms, data collection, social media, networks, simulation, and ritual — yield distinct modes of seeing, thinking, and feeling, structure social organization, and reinforce existing systems of power? Through a balanced study of critical theory and hands-on making workshops, students will create several small projects that explore and question these ideas. No coding experience necessary; an enthusiastic willingness to reconsider how code shapes and is shaped by society required!

“Technology is not neutral. We're inside of what we make, and it's inside of us. We're living in a world of connections — and it matters which ones get made and unmade.” - Donna Haraway

### What will happen in these two weeks?
Classes are held in the evenings Monday-Friday from 6:30-9:30pm with a day off on July 4th. The session will culminate in a party on the afternoon of Saturday July 21st,  where students can invite their friends and present their favorite projects.

Students will have full access to the space for the two weeks of the session to work on projects between classes and mentors will be readily available for technical, conceptual, and artistic guidance.

### How do I apply?
You can apply to this session [**here.**](xx)

We accept up to 15 students on a rolling basis. We will respond to your application within ~1 week of submission. Rolling admissions means there are fewer and fewer slots the longer you wait, so if you’re interested in the program get your application in early!

### How much is tuition?
$2,000 USD for the 3-week program. You’ll also need to cover your own cost of living, including housing and meals (recent alumni report this to be in the range of $800 - $1400). Upon payment, your space in the class will be reserved. SFPC tuition goes directly to paying for the teachers, organizers, materials and space that make sessions like this possible. Unfortunately, due to small size of the overall budget, we can't provide scholarship for intensive program. In the past, students were able to get help from their employer or school to cover the cost. Upon acceptance, SFPC can provide an invitation letter for you.


### What if I can’t go, can I get a refund?
- Yes, we can give you 100% refund up to 5 days before class starts
- 50% refund after 5 days, until the first day of class
- No refunds can be given after the first day of class

### What is expected of me?
- Come to all classes and thoughtfully engage with your classmates and teachers.
- We are looking for autodidacts from all backgrounds who are curious, generous and open.
- We welcome students with a broad array of technical experiences–no coding experience is required, but a basic comfort level with technology is preferred.
- B.Y.O.Laptop (Mac / PC / Linux)

### Where is SFPC?
We are located in 155 Bank street, in the courtyard of the Westbeth Artists Community in the West Village, New York City.
