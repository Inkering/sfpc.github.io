## Call for Students: Creative Coding Bootcamp (online)
- ...., total of 10 classes and additional study sessions held 10 eight weeks.
- Classes will be held Wednesdays from 1pm - 4pm EST.
- Teachers and TAs will be available for additional one-on-one discussions through office hours throughout the session.
- **Applications are now closed.**

In this course, together we will consider the racialized history of surveillance and the positioning of white as neutral within interfaces as forms of violence enacted through high technology. We will discuss in small groups, large discussions, and one-on-one how we all can use computational systems to create change while holding them accountable for their origins and biases. 

By reading critical texts, streaming artworks and interacting with professional guests we will learn how these structures are compromised so that we can begin to imagine what an outside to them might look like. This class relies on an expanded notion of study, where we will challenge one another to think outside the box about what learning is and ultimately can be. We will also look at the practices of contemporary artists critiquing (and expanding the imaginary within) technology as examples of how radical imagination can be evoked through artistic practice. By the end of the class we will publish a digital publication containing original contributions from every member of the class.

### Learning Goals
- The ability to communicate complex ideas through writing and discussion with peers.
- A more conscientious approach to developing new tech and design solutions that reflect our current moment which prioritizes equity.
- A nuanced critical perspective towards technological objects and their generation of power and control in society.
- A thorough knowledge of the history of surveillance practices in the United States.
- An understanding of the economy which assumes the possibility of humans being valued as commodities.
- An interdisciplinary understanding of the relationship between art, design, technology, and economics.


### Who are the teachers?
- [American Artist](https://americanartist.us/) [teacher] is an artist whose work considers black labor and visibility within networked life. Artist is an alumni of the Whitney Independent Study Program and part-time lecturer at The New School. Recent solo exhibitions include My Blue Window, 2019, Queens Museum, NY and I’m Blue (If I Was █████ I Would Die), 2019, Koenig & Clinton, NY.
- [Zainab Aliyu (Zai)](zai.zone) [TA]

### How will the class be conducted?
We will conduct the class online via Zoom between 1 to 4 pm EST on Wednesdays. Teacher and TA will be available at dedicated hours through the week for individual questions and discussion.

In addition to online classes and one-on-ones, we will be using Slack for communication, _____ for sharing course material, Google calendar to stay organized and Calend.ly to schedule one-on-ones. You do not need to create accounts on these services yet, we will send you information once you are accepted.

Over the course of the 10 weeks, we will be working on a collaborative publication relating to themes discussed in class, and by the end of the class we will publish this as a digital publication containing original contributions from every member of the class.

Please be prepared to dedicate up to 5 hours of additional study (readings and assignments) and work time to the class outside of the 3 hours of class time each week.

SFPC fosters a collaborative and relaxed learning environment. We value your questions and want to make sure all students feel comfortable engaging with the teachers and material fully. Although we will not be sitting around the same table, we are committed to offer the same level of support and dedication to this cohort of students.


### What is expected of me?
- The only requirement is that students come with an open mind and an interest in helping one another to learn by providing a welcome learning environment.
- It is suggested that students purchase the books that we will read, but it is not required, all texts will be provided digitally.

### Is this the right class for me?

#### If this sounds like you, then YES!
- I don’t know code and want to learn so I can make 2D-based or visual art.
- I know how HTML/CSS works but haven’t delved deeper into coding.
- My art practice is music/photo/design/language(...) based and I want to learn code so I can play around with some ideas.
- I have learned code in the past but I could use a basic review of concepts (ie, a getting started course makes sense).
- I’d like to have a better grasp on the basics of code (variables, functions, objects) and to learn how to ask questions / get unstuck faster.

#### If this sounds like you, you should consider signing up for an upcoming ‘Recreating the Past’ class with Zach.  Note that bootcamp is geared towards beginners and you may find the first classes a little slow.
- I have a good understanding of what variables, functions, control structures are.  I even may have done object / OOP programming.
- I am a developer at my job but want to expand my knowledge of using code for artistic purposes.
- I have experience with code (C++/P5/P5js/pyton, etc) but not openFrameworks - or - it’s been a while since I’ve played with it.

### How much is tuition?
$550 USD. Upon payment, your space in the class will be reserved.

We are committed to being fully transparent about how we make and spend money. In the spirit of radical openness and generosity, on which the school was founded, [we open-source our finances on Github](https://github.com/sfpc/finance-and-administration). There, you can read financial reports and download raw statements.


### What if I can’t go, can I get a refund?
- Yes, we can give you 100% refund up to 2 days before class starts
- 50% refund after 2 days, until the first day of class
- No refunds can be given after the first day of class


### How do I apply?
Applications are now closed.

We will be accepting up to 17 students on a rolling basis. We will respond to your application within 2 days of submission. Rolling admissions means there are fewer and fewer slots the longer you wait, so if you’re interested in the program get your application in early!
