## Spring 2014 Session

![classes](/img/SPCPicket.jpg)

SFPC (School for poetic computation) will host an intensive two weeks session in New York City from April 20th~May 4th, 2014. It will be a space for students to develop deep curiosity of what it means to work poetically in computational media. SFPC co-founders Zachary Lieberman and Taeyoon Choi will be accompanied by new teachers and visiting artists.


**What will happen in two weeks?**  

* Daily workshops on programming, hardware and theory in an ideal learning environment.
* Teachers will provide technical, conceptual and artistic guide.
* Topics will include animation and computer vision with openFrameworks, basic electronics and robotics, history of art and computation.  
* Series of homeworks and propositions.
* Visiting artists will share their creative process throughout two weeks.
* Peer to Peer collaboration is highly encouraged among participants.  
* 15 participants in one class.  

**Who are we looking for?**

We are looking for participants from diverse backgrounds: artists, programmers, educators, writers and anyone with a passion for poetic computation. Our only expectation is that you are eager to experiment, can learn from failure, and come fully dedicated to this two weeks experience. In the past, we had students with diverse technical experience and we were delighted to learn that everyone had something to learn from our classes and each other.

**How much is tuition?**

Two weeks program will cost 1000 USD. It is directly proportional to the cost of our ten weeks program. The tuition goes to paying for space, teachers and materials. We value transparency in finance.

**Deadline is March 28th, 2014**

Please apply <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1TzmAH_zl3Ygfo-g97coeSXZABtVAYAPMMYjvtz8BJVE/viewform">here!</a> In the past, we recieved 60+ strong applications and we assume this time will be competitive as well. We select participants based on work sample and application form. If you have already applied through our rolling application, we will contact you regarding spring term.

**What is School for poetic computation?**

SFPC is an alternative model for art and technology education. We are striving to create a new kind of school through collaboration between faculty and students. By participating you will be actively shaping an emerging culture of opensource and transparent education. This spring intensive is our next step in sharing the school's mission with a growing community of those who are always curious. We will work from a new space in Brooklyn and are also planning a second full time, 10 week program to start in September of 2014.

The school aims to be more than a technical bootcamp. It is an opportunity to work intensively with a small group of students, faculty and artists to explore questions about the poetics of computation. For us, computation is poetic when technology is used for critical thinking and aesthetic inquiry – a space where logic meets electricity (hardware), math meets language (software) and analytical thinking meets creative experimentation.

<p><b>School for Poetic Computation</b> is an artist run school in New York. It consists of a small group of students and faculty working closely to explore the intersections of code, design, hardware and theory -- focusing especially on artistic intervention, critical thinking and aesthetic inquiry. <i>Our motto is: more poetry, less demo.</i></p>
<p>In the fall of 2013 the school ran its first session in the form of a 10 week program that concluded with an open studio show casing student work at Eyebeam Art and Technology Center. We are about to announce a two-week intensive session for this spring from April 20th~May 4th. This details of this session are as follows:</p>

<p>We are currently accepting proposals for workshops and lectures for the upcoming spring session. We are also interested in arranging artist visits to provide informal tutoring and assistance to smaller groups of students over one or more days. If you are inspired to become a part of this community or wish to continue contributing to it, please fill in the application forms linked at the bottom of this call out.</p>

<h2 id="sponsor">Provide Sponsorship</h2>
<p><b>School for Poetic Computation</b> is a cooperative education program initiated by SFPC.LLC.</p>
<p>We are a non profit organization and we are also not a business running for profit. We value transparency in education and administration.  After covering our costs, we pass on any additional support to our students in the form of reduced fees. This is shown in our financial record from the fall 2013 session is available here. Our aim is to provide the best possible learning experience for our students and teaching experience for our teachers.  Our tuition is already subsidized thanks to some of our teachers donating their fees back to the school and thanks to the generous support of our friends and colleagues in the form of time, visits, mentoring etc.</p>
<p>At the moment we are looking for corporate sponsors or individual donors. While we charge tuition to our students, we still need help with raising funds to rent a space for 20 people, pay an administrator and an accountant. We are not trying to grow in scale, but want to deepen our capacity to teach and to build up facilities available to teachers and students in the form of equipment and insurance. Help us become an inspiring model for what an art and technology education can be. </p>
<p>To provide support to the school for poetic computation, please contact admin@sfpc.io for more details. </p>
<p>We are also able to receive tax deductible donation through our fiscal sponsor, Eyebeam Art and Technology Center.</p>
