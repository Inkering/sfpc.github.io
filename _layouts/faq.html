			<h4>Administration</h4>

			<h5>Is the school for poetic computation a real school?</h5>
			<p>It is a school in the sense that there is a lot of learning and teaching happening in a physical space. It is also a residency for creative practitioners in art and technology to develop their ideas into projects and publish them through documentation and exhibition.</p>

			<h5>Is the school accredited?</h5>
			<p>The school does not issue formal degrees. By participating you will join a group of alumni growing into a lively community of collaborators. We hope students' experience at the school will be a validation for them to pursue a creative career.</p>

			<h5>Who can become a student at the school?</h5>
			<p>Anyone who is excited by our mission statement and wants to transform their ideas into projects. We are hoping to get somewhere between 10~15 students. We are looking for students who will make full time commitment for the period of session.</p>

			<h5>How can I apply?</h5>
			<p>Please check our calls for students in the 'Participate' section of this website. All open calls to upcoming sessions of the school will be listed there. If there are no open calls at the present moment, we will also continue to accept applications on a rolling basis <a target="_blank" href="">here</a>. You can also sign up at our mailing list to get the latest news.</p>

			<h5>Is there tuition to attend the school?</h5>
			<p>Yes, there is a fixed-rate tuition which is based on the cost of running the program and varies by semester.</p>
			<p>We are committed to being fully transparent about how we make and spend money. We open-source <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/SFPC/finance-and-administration">our finances on Github</a>, where you can read <a href="">a report on the first semester</a> and download raw financial statements.</p>
			<p>Tuition for the first semester of sfpc was $5000 for 10 weeks, and at the end of the semester we offered each student a $700 reimbursement for tuition money that we didn't spend. It makes us happy to give money back to students.</p>
			<p>We aspire to provide scholarships to students who cannot afford to attend sfpc, though we are not able to do it yet. If you are interested in helping underwrite scholarships please visit our donor page.</p>
