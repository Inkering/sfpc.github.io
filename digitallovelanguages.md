# Digital Love Languages: Code as Gift 

Date: Starting in June, 2020.
Teacher: Melanie Hoff  
Application is now open. (link) 

How do we want to live in a post COVID-19 world, and what role do we want technology to play? Let us gather for the creation of placemaking on the internet where love and solidarity are valued and supported. As our daily activities and closest relationships become increasingly bound up with corporate systems of surveillance and exploitation,  we need to explore the cultivation of code as a love language that can be gentle, healing, and personal. This class is about building poetic tools for online communion through a re-introduction to computers and a call to action for expanding computation’s capacity for fostering interdependence and creative expression. 

We will build small and personal digital platforms for affirming one another across physical distance. We will explore network-afforded proximity and design digital spaces for ourselves. Technology will be unpacked as a social process, not only a logic or material, regarding code as a craft and medium capable of expressing the full range of feeling and desire. 

This course will be in two parts. The first four weeks will be focused on getting comfortable with the building blocks of programming and natural language processing using Python.  We will look to the history of the love letter as form, from the quill to the sext.

The last four weeks will be an investigation of the browser as a fertile site for ambient and playful communication. Through code and the browser we can facilitate the kind of care that happens in the small moments of routine. In this part of the course we will get comfortable with the building blocks of the web and make browser extensions using javascript. 

This class owes a great deal to the works of bell hooks, Audre Lorde, Olia Lialina, Cory Arcangel, and Allison Parrish. This class is also inspired by BUFU where a group discussion in a Cloud9 workshop called Queering Zoom inspired the title of this class. 

No prior coding experience is necessary, as this class is oriented towards new programmers. We are committed to co-creating with participants an anti-racist, anti-sexist, and environmentally conscious theory of computation. The code of conduct will be co-written by and upheld by all participants. SFPC is a school organized by people who are committed to making space for people who exist at the intersections of oppressed identities, including but not limited to those who are queer, trans, people of color, disabled, Deaf, or hard of hearing.  The pedagogy of this class draws on the lead teacher Melanie Hoff’s experience as a programmer, artist, and organizer of Code Societies, a three week intensive event at the School for Poetic Computation. In Code Societies,  we engage with code and the ways code acts on our bodies and networks, equally as subject and as medium. Code Societies and this class push back against the nearly ubiquitous mode of tech education where learning a technical thing apart from a social history of that thing is the norm. 

# Syllabus

- Building blocks of the web
- Fundamentals of JavaScript
- Coding browser Extensions as poetic ambient communication platforms

# Student Testimonials

“This is hard to put into words, but I feel like Code Societies taught me that the world is more malleable than I knew? That I have the power to influence (physical and digital) space, that I can view the code of any website (and play around with altering it in a text editor!), that the possibilities for speculative design and visioning are so much more expansive than I thought. Relational and digital interfaces feel more alive now. [...] Code Societies made me realize how much trepidation or doubt I still held about interacting with my computer, with code, with the world? I feel like it returned me to a sense of play that I had been looking for. I feel so much more possibility now in every part of my life. Thank you. " - Amber Officer-Narvasa January 2020

“Thanks for always asking us how we are and checking in on us and stuff. I genuinely appreciate the care and attention you give to us as not only students but people too. It makes me feel better knowing that I have a teacher “on my side” that makes an effort to understand us.” - Yanxin Jiang after Melanie Hoff's class at NYU IDM transitioned to online this semester in response to COVID-19, March 2020.

## Instructor Bio

[Melanie Hoff](https://melanie-hoff.com/) is an artist and educator examining the role technology plays in social organization and the reinforcing of hegemonic structures. Their work uncovers and re-scripts coded conventions of norms, interfaces, and sex, through software, installation, and new choreographies of exchange. They are a co-founder of Soft Surplus, (a collective space for making and learning near each other), the Cybernetics Library (an art and research collective offering resources for study and critique of socio-technological systems). They teach at NYU IDM, RISD, and the School for Poetic Computation, where they organize Code Societies, a learning initiative about the social histories of technology and the expressive capacity of coding with care. They have presented their work internationally in spaces like the Tate Exchange London, the New Museum, the Queens Museum, The Internet Archive, Pioneer Works, and elsewhere.

 
### How much is tuition?
$1200 USD. Upon payment, your space in the class will be reserved.

We are committed to being fully transparent about how we make and spend money. In the spirit of radical openness and generosity, on which the school was founded, [we open-source our finances on Github](https://github.com/sfpc/finance-and-administration). There, you can read financial reports and download raw statements.


### What if I can’t go, can I get a refund?
- Yes, we can give you 100% refund up to 10 days before class starts
- 50% refund after 10 days, until the first day of class
- No refunds can be given after the first day of class


### How do I apply?
Applications is now open.  

We will be accepting up to 17 students on a rolling basis. We will respond to your application within 5 days of submission. Rolling admissions means there are fewer and fewer slots the longer you wait, so if you’re interested in the program get your application in early!

### Is this class right for me? 

This class is intended for beginners without much experience in coding. If you have experience with coding, we recommend other classes offered at SFPC.
