  <dt>Is there tuition to attend the school?</dt>
  <dd><p>Yes, there is a fixed-rate tuition which is based on the cost of running the program and varies by semester. We are committed to being fully transparent about how we make and spend money. We open-source our finances on <a href="https://github.com/SFPC/finance-and-administration">Github</a>, where you can read a report on the first semester and download raw financial statements. Tuition for the first semester of sfpc was $5000 for 10 weeks, and at the end of the semester we offered each student a $700 reimbursement for tuition money that we didn't spend. It makes us happy to give money back to students. The cost of shorter semester, for example of 2 weeks program, will be proportional to full semester. We are estimating the cost of 2 weeks program in spring 2014 program will be about $1000. We aspire to provide scholarships to students who cannot afford to attend sfpc, though we are not able to do it yet. If you are interested in helping underwrite scholarships please visit contact us.</p></dd>
