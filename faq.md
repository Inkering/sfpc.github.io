## Administration

### Is the school for poetic computation a real school?

It is a school in the sense that there is a lot of learning and teaching happening in a physical space. It is also a residency for creative practitioners in art and technology to develop their ideas into projects and publish them through documentation and exhibition.

### Is the school accredited?

The school does not issue formal degrees. By participating you will join a group of alumni growing into a lively community of collaborators. We hope students' experience at the school will be a validation for them to pursue a creative career.

### Who can become a student at the school?

Anyone who is excited by our mission statement and wants to transform their ideas into projects. We are hoping to get somewhere between 10~15 students. We are looking for students who will make full time commitment for the period of session.

### How can I apply?

Please check our calls for students in the 'Participate' section of this website.

### Is there tuition to attend the school?

Yes, there is a fixed-rate tuition which is based on the cost of running the program and varies by semester.
We are committed to being fully transparent about how we make and spend money. We open-source <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/SFPC/finance-and-administration">our finances on Github</a>, where you can read <a href="">a report on the first semester</a> and download raw financial statements.

Tuition for the first semester of sfpc was $5000 for 10 weeks, and at the end of the semester we offered each student a $700 reimbursement for tuition money that we didn't spend. It makes us happy to give money back to students.

We aspire to provide scholarships to students who cannot afford to attend sfpc, though we are not able to do it yet. However, we have successfully supported few students to receive grants and support from their work, school and institutions. We will be happy to write a letter of recommendation upon your acceptance. 

### How long is a term of the school?

Sessions of the school vary in length. Fall 2014 session will be held for roughly ten weeks between October 1st~December 12th.

### Where will the school be located?

The school will be run from Orbital in New York City.

### Can Non-US Citizen apply?

Yes! We are designing one session to be 10 week in order to accommodate International students visiting with a tourist visa.

### Can I work while attending this school?

We do not recommend you work during the school because you will not have time and we want all students to be full time.

### Can I come for a portion of the time?

For Fall 2014, we want students to be full time for the whole 10 weeks. We offer shorter programs during the year.

### How many terms per years are you planning?

We are planning about 2 terms per year with different themes, durations and teachers, so students may continue at the school if they'd like.
