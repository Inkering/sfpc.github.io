School for Poetic Computation is a cooperative education program initiated by SFPC.LLC.

## Sponsorship

We are a non profit organization and we are also not a business running for profit. We value transparency in education and administration. After covering our costs, we pass on any additional support to our students in the form of reduced fees. This is shown in our financial record from the fall 2013 session is available here. Our aim is to provide the best possible learning experience for our students and teaching experience for our teachers. Our tuition is already subsidized thanks to some of our teachers donating their fees back to the school and thanks to the generous support of our friends and colleagues in the form of time, visits, mentoring etc.

At the moment we are looking for corporate sponsors or individual donors. While we charge tuition to our students, we still need help with raising funds to rent a space for 20 people, pay an administrator and an accountant. We are not trying to grow in scale, but want to deepen our capacity to teach and to build up facilities available to teachers and students in the form of equipment and insurance. Help us become an inspiring model for what an art and technology education can be.

To provide support to the school for poetic computation, please contact admin@sfpc.io for more details.

We are also able to receive tax deductible donation through our fiscal sponsor, Eyebeam Art and Technology Center.

## Donate Space

Call out to potential spaces

School for Poetic Computation is an artist run school in New York. It consists of a small group of students and faculty working closely to explore the intersections of code, design, hardware and theory -- focusing especially on artistic intervention, critical thinking and aesthetic inquiry. Our motto is: more poetry, less demo.

In the fall of 2013 the school ran its first session in the form of a 10 week program that concluded with an open studio show casing student work at Eyebeam Art and Technology Center. We are about to announce a two-week intensive session this spring from April 20th~May 4th. Our maximum budget for two weeks of space is $1500.

We are currently seeking a space that can host this upcoming two-week session. We require a space that can comfortably accommodate 20 people and that is furnished with tables and chairs. We will be holding daily lectures, workshops and open discussion sessions.

Specifically we also require:

    access from 9am - 10pm daily and during the weekend separating the two weeks
    access to kitchen facilities for cooking and food preparation
    capacity for us install fast wireless internet or use existing network
    central location serviced by public transportation
    flexibility to allows students to work with projectors, sound equipment or install temporary work
    do we have requirements for hosting events/drinks/etc?

SFPC is an experimental model for art and technology education. We are striving to create a new kind of school based on collaboration between faculty and students. By supporting us, you will be actively contributing to an emerging culture of opensource education. We are committed to transparency in all aspects of the school's operation - its administration, admissions process and financial structure. We are attempting to reduce the cost to students in all possible ways and last session, many of our teachers choose to volunteer some or all of their time. The school's financial information from the first session is availiable on github. Any savings made by reducing the costs of hiring a space for the school will be passed directly onto students in the form of lowered tuition fees.

Our spring intensive is the next step in sharing the school's mission and fostering its development in conversation with a wider community of artists and technologists. We are also planning future sessions of the school that will require space and support. We will run the second iteration of our 10 week program to start in September of 2014 and there also may be additional two-week intensives scheduled for later this year.
