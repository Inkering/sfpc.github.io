			<p><p>SFPC frequently asked questions:</p>

<h2 id="administration">Administration</h2>

<dl>
  <pre><code>&lt;dt&gt;Is the school for poetic computation a real school?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;It is a school in the sense that there is a lot of learning and teaching happening in a physical space. It is also a residency for creative practitioners in art and technology to develop their ideas into projects and publish them through documentation and exhibition.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Does the School issue certificate for graduation?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;The school does not issue formal degrees. By participating you will join a group of alumni growing into a lively community of collaborators. We hope students' experience at the school will be a validation for them to pursue a creative career..&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Who can become a student at the school?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;Anyone who is excited by our mission statement and wants to transform their ideas into projects. We are hoping to get somewhere between 10~15 students. We are looking for students who will make full time commitment for the period of session. &lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;How can I apply?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;Please check our calls for students in the 'Participate' section of this website. All open calls to upcoming sessions of the school will be listed there. You can also sign up at our mailing list to get the latest news.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Is there tuition to attend the school?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;Yes, there is a fixed-rate tuition which is based on the cost of running the program and varies by semester.
        We are committed to being fully transparent about how we make and spend money. We open-source our finances on &lt;a href="https://github.com/SFPC/finance-and-administration"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;, where you can read a report on the first semester and download raw financial statements.
        Tuition for the first semester of sfpc was $5000 for 10 weeks, and at the end of the semester we offered each student a $700 reimbursement for tuition money that we didn't spend. It makes us happy to give money back to students.
        The cost of shorter semester, for example of 2 weeks program, will be proportional to full semester. We are estimating the cost of 2 weeks program in spring 2014 program will be about $1000.
        We aspire to provide scholarships to students who cannot afford to attend sfpc, though we are not able to do it yet. If you are interested in helping underwrite scholarships please visit contact us.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;How long is a term of the school?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;Sessions of the school vary in length. Our Spring 2014 will be a two week intensive. We are also planning a ten week fall session.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Where will the school be located?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;In the fall of 2013, we were located in Downtown Brooklyn, New York at the Metropolitan Exchange. In the spring of 2014, we will be located in Manhattan &lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Can Non-US Citizen apply?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;Yes! We are designing one session to be 10 week in order to accommodate International students visiting with a visitor visa.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Can I work while attending the school?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;No, we want all students to be full time during the 10 weeks.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;How many terms per years are you planning?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;We are planning 2 or 3 terms per year with different themes and teachers, so students may continue at the school if they'd like.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Can I come for a portion of the time?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;No, we want students to be full time for the whole 10 weeks.&lt;/dd&gt;

<h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h2>

<dl>
  <pre><code>&lt;dt&gt;What are the core principles the school stands for?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;Hacking, exploration, open source, publish everything and often, tools for building, deep understanding through hands on experience and so on&amp;#8230;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;What kind of students are you looking for?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt; We want to work with students who are creative at heart and dedicated to learning and teaching code and technology in general. We like students who are kind to help one another.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Where did this idea come from?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt; We have been teaching and organizing workshops at schools and festivals around the world. We want to create a safe haven for others to develop ideas into reality. We want to bring all of our experience and knowledge to make a sustainable system for learning and teaching code, electronics, installation, performance, user experience, data visualization and etc.&lt;/dd&gt;

<h2 id="pedagogy">Pedagogy</h2>

<dl>
  <pre><code>&lt;dt&gt;What is the teaching philosophy?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;We celebrate failure and collaboration. Our classes are going to be a mix of lecture, demo and lab hours. We respect our students and support them as artist and educator. We hope our students will have the experience to create projects on their own and to teach after the program.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;How much of programming skills do I need to get accepted?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;The School encourages students to have some familiarity with programming and technology in general. If you are an absolute beginner, there will be assignments prior to the School that will get you familiar with the medium.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;What other schools like this exist?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;Here's a list of shorter, non degree granting schools: &lt;a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/"&gt;hacker school&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.codefellows.org/rails"&gt;code fellows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.starterleague.com/"&gt;starter league&lt;/a&gt;. There's also places like &lt;a href="http://thebrooklyninstitute.com/the-institute"&gt;the brooklyn institute&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://lagamespace.org/alpha/"&gt;LA game space&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="kitchentablecoders.com"&gt;kitchen table coders&lt;/a&gt;.
      &lt;a href="http://teachablefile.org/"&gt;Teachablefile&lt;/a&gt; is a huge list of artist run schools. This book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-School-Propositions-21st-Century/dp/0262134934"&gt;Art School: (Propositions for the 21st Century)&lt;/a&gt;, is a good intro to alternative art schools.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Why do you teach?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;Teaching inspires to continue to learn. We love meeting new people and we often make our best work in collaboration with others. Big part of our school is to create sustainable community of practitioners that will grow over years to collaborate on projects and teach wider community. We are proud of our first class of students from 2013 and we maintain an active mailing list. &lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;How can I help?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;We would love to hear what you want to help with. At the moment, we are looking for help with visiting lectures, design, PR and space management.
