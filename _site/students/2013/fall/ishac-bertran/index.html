			<h1>Ishac Bertran</h1>
			<p><p>Ishac Bertran is an engineer and designer from Barcelona. He is interested in technology, design and art, and how those disciplines feed our culture.</p>

<p>Ishac holds an MA in Mechanical Engineering, and graduated from Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design, where he was also involved as faculty and thesis advisor. He first worked as an R&amp;D engineer in Hewlett-Packard, and later in innovation consultancies for clients such as Toyota or Nestl√©. Last year he moved to NYC, where he has done design work for Google, fifty-three and B-Reel. In parallel, Ishac works on self driven projects, exploring technologies, processes, materials and combinations of them. He has recently done experiments in computer-generated photography, fictional forms of interaction and self-published a poetry book written in code. His work has received international recognition (IxDA, Core77 awards) and has been featured in numerous exhibitions and publications (Lift, Salone Internazionale del Mobile, Wired, Fast Company, Make).</p>

<p>Ishac is always curious about new forms of creative expression and new methods for education - these are just a few reasons why he joined SFPC.</p>
