          <h2>Participate</h2>
          <p><img src="http://localhost:1313/static/media/SPCpicket.jpg" alt="classes" />
</p>

<p><strong>Application form is now online <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1TzmAH_zl3Ygfo-g97coeSXZABtVAYAPMMYjvtz8BJVE/viewform">here!</a></strong></p>

<p>SFPC (School for poetic computation) will host an intensive two week session in New York City. The spring term will run from April 20th~May 4th and will be a space for students to develop a deep curiosity of what it means to work poetically in computational media. SFPC co-founders Zachary Lieberman and Taeyoon Choi will be accompanied by new teachers.</p>

<p><strong>What will happen in two weeks?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Daily workshops on programming, hardware and theory in an ideal learning environment.</li>
<li>Teachers will provide technical, conceptual and artistic guide.</li>
<li>Topics will include animation and computer vision with openFrameworks, basic electronics and robotics, history of art and computation.<br /></li>
<li>Artists in residence will share their creative process throughout two weeks.</li>
<li>Peer to Peer collaboration is highly encouraged.<br /></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Who are we looking for?</strong></p>

<p>We are looking for participants from diverse backgrounds: artists, programmers, educators, writers and anyone with a passion for poetic computation. Our only expectation is that you are eager to experiment, can learn from failure, and come fully dedicated to this two week experience. In the past, we had students with diverse technical experience and we were delighted to learn that everyone had something to learn from our classes.</p>

<p><strong>How much is tuition?</strong></p>

<p>Two weeks program will cost 1000 USD. It is directly proportional to the cost of our ten weeks program. The tuition goes to paying for space, teachers and materials.</p>

<p><strong>Deadline is March 28th, 2014</strong></p>

<p>If you have already applied through our rolling application, we will contact you regarding spring term.</p>

<p><strong>What is School for poetic computation?</strong></p>

<p>SFPC is an alternative model for art and technology education. We are striving to create a new kind of school through collaboration between faculty and students. By participating you will be actively shaping an emerging culture of opensource and transparent education. This spring intensive is our next step in sharing the school&rsquo;s mission with a growing community of those who are always curious. We will work from a new space in Brooklyn and are also planning a second full time, 10 week program to start in September of 2014.</p>

<p>The school aims to be more than a technical bootcamp. It is an opportunity to work intensively with a small group of students, faculty and artists to explore questions about the poetics of computation. For us, computation is poetic when technology is used for critical thinking and aesthetic inquiry â€“ a space where logic meets electricity (hardware), math meets language (software) and analytical thinking meets creative experimentation.</p>
