          <h2>Participate</h2>
          <p>Application form is now online <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1TzmAH_zl3Ygfo-g97coeSXZABtVAYAPMMYjvtz8BJVE/viewform">here!</a></p>

<p>The school for poetic computation will host an intensive two week session in New York City. The spring term will run from April 20th~May 4th and will be a space for students to develop a deep curiosity of what it means to work creatively in all forms of computational media.</p>

<p>The school aims to be more than a technical bootcamp. It is an opportunity to work intensively with a small group of students, faculty and artists to explore questions about the poetics of computation. For us, computation is poetic when technology is used for critical thinking and aesthetic inquiry â€“ a space where logic meets electricity (hardware), math meets language (software) and analytical thinking meets creative experimentation.</p>

<p>We are looking for participants from diverse backgrounds: artists, hackers, educators, writers and anyone with a passion for creative computation. Our only expectation is that you are eager to experiment, can learn from failure, and come fully dedicated to this two week experience. The program will include ten workshops and a daily lecture series exploring programming, physical computing and history of media art. Sessions will be lead by the school&rsquo;s founders and visiting artists and technologists including several alumni from the school&rsquo;s first class.</p>

<p>SFPC is an alternative model for art and technology education. We are striving to create a new kind of school through collaboration between faculty and students. By participating you will be actively shaping an emerging culture of opensource and transparent education. This spring intensive is our next step in sharing the school&rsquo;s mission with a growing community of those who are always curious. We will work from a new space in Brooklyn and are also planning a second full time, 10 week program to start in September of 2014.</p>
