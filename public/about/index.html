          <h2>About</h2>
          
          <p>School for poetic computation was founded by Amit, Jen, Taeyoon and Zach in 2013. Each semester we work with new teachers and visiting artists to make ideal learning environment. In spring 2014, Zach, Taeyoon and Casey are leading administration of the school. 

We are a group of artists, hackers and educators who are super committed to open source and open hardware, to radical openness and generosity.

<h2>Amit Pitaru</h2>

<p><a href="http://pitaru.com/">Amit</a> is a coder and designer. Formerly a professional musician, his work to date spans across experimental art, research, education, and entrepreneurial projects. A recurring theme in Amit’s work is the extreme attention to user-experience, specifically how technology can promote (or destroy) curiosity, literacy, and creativity.</p>

<p>As an artist, Amit develops novel instruments and methods for making music, animation, and dance. His work has been exhibited at the London Design Museum, Paris Pompidou Center, Lincoln Center, Israel National Museum, Sundance Film festival, Seoul Metropolitan Museum of Art, and ICC Museum in Tokyo.</p>

<p>As an educator, Amit develops curricula that focus on the coupling of technology and the creative thought process. He taught at New York University’s ITP and Cooper Union’s Arts department.
